## Files and Functions

### `data/sample_data.xlsx`

- A sample Excel file for testing the pipeline. Replace or expand it with your trading data.

### `notebooks/trading\_analysis.ipynb`

- A Jupyter notebook demonstrating:

- Bid and Ask price analysis.

- Bid-Ask spreads.

- Order book imbalance visualization.

- Moving averages calculations.

### `src/backtest.py`

- Script to implement and backtest a trading strategy using moving averages:

- Includes a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy.

- Utilizes the Backtrader library to simulate trades and analyze performance.

### `src/data\_processing.py`

- Script for loading and preprocessing trading data:

- Filters data by time range.

- Calculates metrics such as bid-ask spreads and order book imbalance.

### `results/plots/`

- A placeholder directory to store any visualizations or outputs generated by the notebook or scripts.
